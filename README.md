    The Erode Gurunaadhaswami Temple, also known as Sri Gurunatha Swamy Temple, is located in Pudupalayam near Anthiyur in Erode district, Tamil Nadu. The temple is believed to be around 600 years old, with traditions linking its construction to the Pandya dynasty, as evidenced by the fish emblems carved in the temple. The presiding deity, Lord Gurunatha Swamy, is worshipped alongside Goddess Kamakshi Amman and Lord Vishnu. A unique feature of the temple is the worship of a boulder as Lord Shiva and Muruga, inspired by the local legend that Lord Muruga taught the Panchatchara Mantra to Shiva at this location. The temple is also famous for its annual festival during the Tamil month of Aadi (mid-July to mid-August), which includes a renowned horse and cattle fair that attracts visitors from all over India. The temple serves as a spiritual and cultural center for the local community and remains an important pilgrimage site in the region.

    Bhavanisagar Dam, also called the Lower Bhavani Dam, is a massive earthen dam located near Erode in Tamil Nadu, built between 1948 and 1955 after India's independence. Stretching 8 to 9 kilometers, it stands as one of the world’s largest earthen dams and is the second largest in Tamil Nadu after Mettur Dam. The dam is constructed across the Bhavani River, a major tributary of the Kaveri, and supports a reservoir with a capacity of 32.8 billion cubic feet. Bhavanisagar Dam plays a critical role in providing irrigation water across Erode, Tiruppur, and neighboring districts, controlling floods, and generating hydroelectric power through its two power stations. The area around the dam is also a popular tourist spot, featuring gardens, play areas, boating, and birdwatching opportunities, with regular bus access from Erode and Coimbatore
