    The Erode Gurunaadhaswami Temple, also known as Sri Gurunatha Swamy Temple, is located in Pudupalayam near Anthiyur in Erode district, Tamil Nadu. The temple is believed to be around 600 years old, with traditions linking its construction to the Pandya dynasty, as evidenced by the fish emblems carved in the temple. The presiding deity, Lord Gurunatha Swamy, is worshipped alongside Goddess Kamakshi Amman and Lord Vishnu. A unique feature of the temple is the worship of a boulder as Lord Shiva and Muruga, inspired by the local legend that Lord Muruga taught the Panchatchara Mantra to Shiva at this location. The temple is also famous for its annual festival during the Tamil month of Aadi (mid-July to mid-August), which includes a renowned horse and cattle fair that attracts visitors from all over India. The temple serves as a spiritual and cultural center for the local community and remains an important pilgrimage site in the region.
