    Bhavanisagar Dam, also called the Lower Bhavani Dam, is a massive earthen dam located near Erode in Tamil Nadu, built between 1948 and 1955 after India's independence. Stretching 8 to 9 kilometers, it stands as one of the worldâ€™s largest earthen dams and is the second largest in Tamil Nadu after Mettur Dam. The dam is constructed across the Bhavani River, a major tributary of the Kaveri, and supports a reservoir with a capacity of 32.8 billion cubic feet. Bhavanisagar Dam plays a critical role in providing irrigation water across Erode, Tiruppur, and neighboring districts, controlling floods, and generating hydroelectric power through its two power stations. The area around the dam is also a popular tourist spot, featuring gardens, play areas, boating, and birdwatching opportunities, with regular bus access from Erode and Coimbatore
